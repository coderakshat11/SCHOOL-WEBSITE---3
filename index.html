        <p class="text-muted">School Library Journal (SLJ) is an American monthly magazine containing reviews and other
          articles for school librarians, media specialists, and public librarians who work with young people. Articles
          cover a wide variety of topics, with a focus on technology, multimedia, and other information resources that
          are
          likely to interest young learners. Reviews are classified by the target audience of the publications:
          preschool;
          schoolchildren to 4th grade, grades 5 and up, and teens; and professional librarians themselves ("professional
          reading"). Fiction, non-fiction, and reference books books are reviewed, as are graphic novels, multimedia,
          and
          digital resources</p>

        <p class="text-muted">It was a decent enough auditorium for watching plays or shows. All the seats have a
          wonderful view.The sound system was reasonably good. There is ample parking, but still better to reach a
          little early to avoid delays
          due to congestion at the parking area. Overall a great place to watch a show</p>

            <p>Pollution prevention is any practice that reduces, eliminates, or prevents pollution at its source. P2,
              also known as “source reduction,” is the ounce-of-prevention approach to waste management. Reducing the
              amount of pollution produced means less waste to control, treat, or dispose of. Less pollution means less
              hazards posed to public health and the environment.</p>
